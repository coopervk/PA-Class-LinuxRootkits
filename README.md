# Rootkits, Kernel Modules, Oh My!

This repository includes modules and rootkits made while following the "Linux
Rootkits for Red-Blue Teams" course from Pentester Academy.

I learned a fair amount from this class, so you should consider getting your own
subscription for better, full explanations of the contents.

If you are looking for a demonstration of my ability, look at the later projects
rather than the earlier ones. I put into place new things I learn like proper
Linux style formatting of certain things, fix small logic bugs, etc
